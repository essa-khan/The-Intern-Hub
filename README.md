# The Intern Hub

The Intern Hub - Most Creative Hack Award

I lead a team of 11 in a State Farm-wide hackathon with 78 teams and ~670 participants across all hubs. In light of State Farm’s decision to continue their Summer Internship program remotely, our team created a one-stop-shop for every intern’s basic needs. We developed The Intern Hub, a web app to guide interns during the onboarding process and well beyond their beginning weeks.
